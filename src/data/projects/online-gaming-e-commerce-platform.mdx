### Overview

In 2018, I created a e-commerce platform for selling game coins using Laravel as the framework and MySQL for the database.

### Details

The frontend was designed using Bootstrap for a sleek and user-friendly interface. The platform was equipped with a secure payment gateway integration with Coinbase, Paypal, and G2A to provide customers with various payment options. An admin panel was also developed for monitoring and tracking sales, orders, and game coin deliveries.

### Conclusion

Unfortunately, the website had to be taken down after the client decided to end the company and its operations.
