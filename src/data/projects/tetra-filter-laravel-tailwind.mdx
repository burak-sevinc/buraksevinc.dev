### Overview

I am excited to share with you my latest web development project, Tetra Filter. This website was built entirely from scratch, using Laravel, MySQL for the database and for css TailwindCSS.

### Frameworks

Laravel, a powerful PHP-based web application framework, was the good choice for the backend of Tetra Filter. Its elegant syntax and robust tools made it easy to handle the server-side logic and database management. I utilized MySQL to store all of the website's data and Laravel's Eloquent ORM made it simple to interact with the database.

On the frontend, I decided to use TailwindCSS - a utility-first CSS framework that's known for its speed and efficiency. With TailwindCSS, I was able to create a visually appealing and responsive design that looks great on all devices. Its pre-designed components and customizable classes allowed me to build a layout that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the combination of Laravel, MySQL, and TailwindCSS allowed me to create a website that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. I hope you enjoy exploring the site and I look forward to hearing your feedback.
