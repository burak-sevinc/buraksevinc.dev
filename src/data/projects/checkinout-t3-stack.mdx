### Checkinout Project

Enhancing Web Experiences with the T3 Stack, MySQL, and Mantine.dev

The T3 stack, which includes Next.js, trpc.io, and Prisma, empowers me to build performant and scalable web applications. MySQL, with the help of Planetscale for managed database hosting, ensures efficient data management. Mantine.dev, a React component library, streamlines UI development, allowing me to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

By combining these technologies, I deliver exceptional web experiences that prioritize performance, data integrity, and user satisfaction.
