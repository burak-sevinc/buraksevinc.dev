I would like to introduce you to the CRM project I made for a foreign trade company, which will only be used by its employees.

### Technical Details

The Project system was built utilizing the Laravel framework, which is known for its stability and versatility. The database was powered by MySQL, a well-established relational database management system. The frontend was designed using the latest version of Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and modern look, along with various jQuery libraries to provide enhanced interactivity and functionality.

### Customization

One of the strengths of this CRM system is its customization to meet the specific needs of the company. I worked closely with the employees and managers to understand their requirements and incorporated them into the final product, resulting in a solution that effectively addresses their unique challenges and improves their workflows.

### Continuous Development

The project was delivered in 2020, but I am committed to providing ongoing support and development as the company grows and evolves. I am available to implement new features and improvements as needed.

### Conclusion

As a freelance developer, I am proud to have delivered a successful CRM project for this Turkish company. It demonstrates my technical abilities and my dedication to providing customized solutions that meet the unique needs of each client. If you are interested in learning more about this project or exploring how I can assist with your next project, please don't hesitate to contact me.
