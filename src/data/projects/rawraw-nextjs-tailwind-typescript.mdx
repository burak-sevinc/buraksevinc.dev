RawRaw is an hobby project that was I created with the purpose of reinforcing knowledge of Next.js and Typescript. 

The game's simple logic and interactive design make it an enjoyable way to learn and apply these technologies in a real-world setting. 

By using Next.js, Typescript, and TailwindCSS in the development of RawRaw, I was able to gain hands-on a bit experience in these technologies.

The game project also helped I to learn about hosting websites on Vercel.
